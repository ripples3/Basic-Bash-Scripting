### Let's create a simple scirpt

1. We will create a file, first.sh (you can use any text editor)
2. The first line will be **#! /bin/sh** (it tells the interpreter that it is a bash script).
3. We will write a command ls(list the subfolders in the directory)

```
#! /bin/sh
ls
```
4. Run the script by executing command **./first.sh**

Suppose, you have to push a commit to your git repository. Instead of writing the commands one by one, we can write a shell script that automates the whole process. Create a file git.sh

```
#! /bin/sh 
git add .
git commit -m $1
git push origin master
```
We will automate the process of pushing commit to the repo. $1 is a variable that will get the input that the user will provide.
To run this script, execute ./git.sh ‘initial commit’. ‘initial commit’ will be placed at the $1.


### Comments
Comments in shell scripts are followed by #.
```
# This is a comment.
```

### Variables
Variables are declared using the =
```
MY_NAME='Morty' #No spaces 
```
```
NAME="John"
echo $NAME
echo "$NAME"
echo "${NAME}!"
```
Variables are accessed using the $ sign.

### String
String are assigned to a variable
```
NAME="John"
echo "Hi $NAME"  #=> Hi John
echo 'Hi $NAME'  #=> Hi $NAME
```


### Echo
Echo is used to display the statement in the shell just like printf in C language.
```
MY_NAME='Morty' 
echo "My name is $MY_NAME"

<Output>
# My name is Morty
```

### Conditional Statements
Let’s see how an if else statement looks in bash scripting.
```
if [[condition]];
then
# write the then instructions here
else
# write the else instructions here
fi
```
```
if [[ -z "$string" ]]; then
  echo "String is empty"
elif [[ -n "$string" ]]; then
  echo "String is not empty"
fi

```
### Conditional execution
These are some of conditions
```
git commit && git push
git commit || echo "Commit failed"
```

### Functions
Functions are group of statements that together perform a task.
```
get_name() {
  echo "John"
}
echo "You are $(get_name)"
```

### Loops
 Loops are a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached
#### Basic for loop
```
for i in /etc/rc.*; do
  echo $i
done
```
#### Forever
```
while true; do
  ···
done
```
#### Ranges
```
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Welcome $i"
done

#With step size
for i in {5..50..5}; do
    echo "Welcome $i"
done
```

### Functions
#### Defining Functions
```
myfunc() {
    echo "hello $1"
}
# ------------------------------------

# Same as above (alternate syntax)
function myfunc() {
    echo "hello $1"
}

myfunc "John"
```
#### Returning values
```
myfunc() {
    local myresult='some value'
    echo $myresult
}
# ------------------------------------
result="$(myfunc)"
```

#### Raising Errors
```
myfunc() {
  return 1
}
# ------------------------------------
if myfunc; then
  echo "success"
else
  echo "failure"
fi
```

### Conditional Statements
Note that [[ is actually a command/program that returns either 0 (true) or 1 (false). Any program that obeys the same logic (like all base utils, such as grep(1) or ping(1)) can be used as condition, see examples.

#### Conditions
| Condition              | Function       |
| ------------------- |:----------------:|
| [[ -z STRING ]]     | Empty string     |
| [[ -n STRING ]]	    | Not empty string |
| [[ STRING == STRING ]]	    | Not Equal |
| [[ NUM -eq NUM ]]	    | Equal |
| [[ NUM -ne NUM ]]	    | Not equal |
| [[ NUM -lt NUM ]]	    | Less than |
| [[ NUM -le NUM ]]	    | Less than or equal |
| [[ NUM -gt NUM ]]	    | Greater than |
| [[ NUM -ge NUM ]]	    | Greater than or equal |
| [[ STRING =~ STRING ]]	    | Regexp |
| (( NUM < NUM ))	    | Numeric conditions |
| [[ -o noclobber ]]    | If OPTIONNAME is enabled |
| [[ ! EXPR ]]   | Not |
| [[ X ]] && [[ Y ]]   | And |
| [[ X ]] || [[ Y ]]    | Or |

#### File Conditions
| Condition              | Function       |
| ------------------- |:----------------:|
| [[ -e FILE ]]	      |  Exists  |
| [[ -r FILE ]]	| Readable |
| [[ -h FILE ]]	 | Symlink |
| [[ -d FILE ]] |	Directory |
| [[ -w FILE ]] |	Writable |
| [[ -s FILE ]] |	Size is > 0 bytes |
| [[ -f FILE ]]	| File |
| [[ -x FILE ]]	 | Executable |
| [[ FILE1 -nt FILE2 ]]	| 1 is more recent than 2 |
| [[ FILE1 -ot FILE2 ]]	| 2 is more recent than 1 |
| [[ FILE1 -ef FILE2 ]]	| Same files |
